Azure AI Foundry – Internal Documentation Chatbot Pilot Plan

Objective:
Develop a secure, company-internal chatbot to query engineering documentation (code, infra, app dev) using Azure AI Foundry.

1. Services & Components
- Azure AI Foundry – for building prompt flows, orchestration, and RAG pipelines.
- Azure OpenAI Service – GPT-4/4o models for generation.
- Azure AI Search – for automatic document chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
- Azure Blob Storage / SharePoint – data source integration for document ingestion.
- Azure Monitor + Application Insights – to track usage and performance.

2. Security & Compliance
- Hosted within our Azure tenant; no external API exposure.
- Data indexed only through private endpoints.
- RBAC & managed identities to restrict access.
- Alignment with internal security and compliance policies (no external LLM traffic).

3. Estimated Costs (Pilot Scope)
- Azure OpenAI tokens: ₹10–15K/month (depends on usage).
- Azure AI Search (S1 tier): ₹5–8K/month.
- Foundry / storage overhead: ₹3–5K/month.
(Exact billing depends on scale and retention period.)

4. Two-Week POC Checklist
Week 1: Setup Azure AI Foundry workspace, connect OpenAI + AI Search, ingest 5–10 sample docs, validate embeddings.
Week 2: Build Prompt Flow, test targeted Q&A over internal docs, configure RBAC, present demo to security & stakeholders.

Outcome:
A secure, functional prototype chatbot demonstrating document retrieval and Q&A using Azure AI Foundry’s built-in RAG and vector indexing—without open-source dependencies.
